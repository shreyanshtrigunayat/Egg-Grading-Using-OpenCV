This is an Machine learning Project made using opencv . In this project I have collected egg datasets through researches and Annotated the images with specific annotations on the images so ,that model will trained and deployable. I have use the roboflow tool to deploy the model.
It has precision about 70.8% , mAP 55.1% and recall 39.0%
